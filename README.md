# U.S. Tax Assistant for Microsoft Teams

A Teams bot that provides expert guidance on U.S. federal and state tax information using AI-powered responses with built-in tax knowledge.

## Overview

U.S. Tax Assistant is a Microsoft Teams bot that helps users navigate the complex U.S. tax system by providing clear explanations and guidance on tax-related questions. The bot leverages OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model with access to the complete U.S. Tax Code (Title 26â€”Internal Revenue Code) and the internet to deliver accurate and helpful tax information.

## Features

- **Tax Regulation Explanations**: Clear explanations of specific tax regulations and their practical applications
- **Tax Form Assistance**: Help selecting the appropriate tax forms for different situations
- **Deduction & Credit Guidance**: Personalized advice on available deductions, credits, and filing status options
- **Common Question Answers**: Detailed responses to frequently asked tax questions
- **Resource Recommendations**: Guidance to additional resources for complex tax issues
- **Persistent Conversations**: Conversation history is preserved between sessions
- **Automatic Disclaimers**: AI-powered classification system adds appropriate disclaimers to tax advice
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Uses OpenAI's file search capability with a custom vector store to provide accurate U.S. Tax Code information
- **Internet Access**: Ability to search the web for the latest tax information, IRS publications, and state-specific tax guidance when needed

## Target Audience

- Individual taxpayers
- Small business owners
- Tax professionals seeking quick reference information

## Technical Architecture

The U.S. Tax Assistant is built using:

- **Microsoft Bot Framework**: Core Teams bot functionality
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime
- **Azure App Service**: Cloud hosting platform
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Persistent conversation history storage
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4.1 model for AI-powered responses
- **OpenAI Vector Store**: Retrieval-augmented generation for accessing the U.S. Tax Code
- **Azure Managed Identity**: Secure authentication for Azure resources

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft 365 for Business account
- Node.js (18.x or 20.x)
- Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code
- Azure subscription (with valid resource group)
- OpenAI API key
- OpenAI Vector Store ID for accessing the U.S. Tax Code knowledge base

### Environment Setup

This repository contains sample environment files that show the required configuration structure without exposing sensitive information. When setting up the project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the sample environment files to create your configuration files:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment sample files
   cp env/.env.dev.sample env/.env.dev
   cp env/.env.dev.user.sample env/.env.dev.user
   cp env/.env.local.sample env/.env.local
   cp env/.env.local.user.sample env/.env.local.user
   cp env/.env.testtool.sample env/.env.testtool
   cp infra/azure.parameters.json.sample infra/azure.parameters.json
   ```

2. Update each file with your configuration values (refer to the table below)

3. Keep your configuration files private:
   - The .gitignore is configured to exclude real configuration files while allowing sample files
   - Never commit files containing real credentials or API keys
   - Each developer should maintain their own local configuration

### Required Configuration Values

| File | Key Configuration Values |
|------|--------------------------|
| .env.dev | AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, RESOURCE_SUFFIX |
| .env.dev.user | OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_VECTOR_STORE_ID, BOT_LOCATION_COUNTRY, BOT_LOCATION_REGION, BOT_LOCATION_CITY, BOT_TIMEZONE |
| azure.parameters.json | openAiApiKey, openAiVectorStoreId, botLocationCountry, botLocationRegion, botLocationCity, botTimezone |

### OpenAI Vector Store Configuration

The U.S. Tax Assistant uses OpenAI's file search capability to retrieve and provide accurate information from the U.S. Tax Code. This requires:

1. **Vector Store ID**: A unique identifier for your OpenAI vector store that contains the indexed U.S. Tax Code.
   - Format: `vs_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - This ID must be configured in all environment files as described in the table above
   - In production (Azure), this is set via the Azure App Service configuration

2. **Creating a Vector Store**: If you need to create your own vector store:
   - Download the PDF version of Title 26 (Internal Revenue Code) from the official U.S. House of Representatives website: https://uscode.house.gov/download/download.shtml
   - Extract the zip file containing the PDF document
   - Split the PDF into 100-page segments for easier upload using software such as Adobe Acrobat
   - Create a vector store for these documents in the OpenAI developer site: https://platform.openai.com/storage/vector_stores/
   - Upload the U.S. Tax Code documents to the vector store
   - Use the resulting vector store ID in your configuration

3. **Vector Store Best Practices**:
   - Keep your vector store updated with the latest tax code changes
   - For best results, process the tax code into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks before indexing
   - Consider including IRS publications and regulations for comprehensive coverage

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up environment files as described above
3. Start the bot locally by pressing F5

### Deployment

This project uses Teams Toolkit to streamline deployment to Azure:

1. Ensure you have the Teams Toolkit extension installed in VS Code
2. Use the Teams Toolkit deployment commands
3. The deployment will:
   - Create an Azure Bot registration
   - Deploy to Azure App Service
   - Configure necessary authentication
   - Upload the app package to Teams

## Architecture

- **teamsBot.js**: Core bot logic, handles messages and OpenAI API integration
- **taxDisclaimerClassifier.js**: AI-based classifier to determine when tax disclaimers are needed
- **storageService.js**: Manages persistent conversation storage in Azure Blob Storage
- **index.js**: Express server setup and initialization
- **infra/**: Contains Bicep infrastructure-as-code files for Azure deployment

## Security Features

- Uses Azure Managed Identity for secure, passwordless authentication
- Implements Storage Blob Data Contributor role assignment for least privilege
- Securely manages OpenAI API keys in Azure App Service configuration
- Implements fallback storage mechanisms for reliability

## Commands

- **/restart**: Clears conversation history and starts a new session

## Troubleshooting

- Check the bot's logs in the Azure CLI (after authenticating your session) by entering the following command: `az webapp log tail --name YourAppName --resource-group YourResourceGroupName`
- Ensure the OpenAI API key is correctly set in the App Service configuration
- Verify the bot has proper permissions to access Azure Blob Storage
